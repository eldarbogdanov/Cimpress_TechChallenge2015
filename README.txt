This is my solution to Cimpress(Vistaprint)'s tech challenge hosted on
http://cimpress.com/techchallenge/. In case the link doesn't work
any more, the problem was: given a grid with some cells cut out, cover
the existing cells with as few non-overlapping squares as you can.

The solution was awarded one of 10 honorable mentions in the finals.
